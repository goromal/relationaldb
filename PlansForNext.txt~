When cycling through schemes, compile a map<pred_name, predicate_obj> for all predicate definitions

When cycling through facts, pair instance predicates with definition predicates using the definition map and ".. = .. + ..." operations to fill up a relations map. If a predicate is missing from the definition map, throw an error. 

--------------------------------------------------------

insert const stuff like in relation.h wherever appropriate and useful.

------OPTIMIZATION---------
- comment out ALL expression / shared_ptr things [X]
- implement algorithm as project description says [X]
- go through all methods in rule and query evaluation and make sure variables passed by reference [X..]
	- and const [X..]
- comment out assert statements

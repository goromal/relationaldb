When cycling through schemes, compile a map<pred_name, predicate_obj> for all predicate definitions

When cycling through facts, pair instance predicates with definition predicates using the definition map and ".. = .. + ..." operations to fill up a relations map. If a predicate is missing from the definition map, throw an error. 

--------------------------------------------------------

insert const stuff like in relation.h wherever appropriate and useful.

------PREP FOR PART 4---------
- make intersect method for tuples
- Project should rearrange head to match the order given (if it doesn't already)
